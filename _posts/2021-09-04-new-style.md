I just updated this site's stylesheet. I'm doing all styling from scratch
rather than using any CSS framework as a starting point.

I wanted to get a feel for solving problems using both modern CSS and some
SASS/SCSS pre-processing. It ended up not taking too much effort. It turns
out that all the complicated style issues I normally deal with are from
developing rich user interfaces and input forms. A simple blog doesn't
take much work, though I kept tweaking the code syntax highlighting colors.

```html
<aside>
    <p class="rhetorical">What do you think?</p>
</aside>
```

I do want to come back and add dark/light theme switching and some light
animations, just for fun.
