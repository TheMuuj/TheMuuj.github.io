# Hello, Interwebs

My first blog, which I had dubbed a "Web Journal" as the word "blog" wasn't
a thing yet, was run on a custom Classic ASP application backed by a Microsoft
Access database. I used it to learn web programming, including up-and-coming
technologies like CSS and RSS, as well as basic database design. Over the
years, being being written in VBScript with old legacy technologies, it became
difficult to maintain and keep secure from spammers, who were also beginning
to take over the web.

Also, my friends and family members who shared the platform became busy with
their lives and stopped contributing as much.

And the cost of Windows hosting with Classic ASP never seemed to come down.
Matter of fact, my host of many years added ASP.NET and raised rates and
provided less and less acceptable levels of support.

Later, I would try blogging at various times using WordPress. I learned how to
install WordPress, customize Themes, use a Linux server, and manage a MySql
database on the web. It was cheap to host, for sure. But no matter what I did,
I was never happy with WordPress as a platform, either for blogs or for simple
websites. And any level of customization meant dealing with PHP and a mess
of jumbled HTML markup.

Also, the popularity of WordPress meant keeping the installations up to date,
lest your installation get hacked.

Now I'm going to give Jekyll a try. I use Markdown almost daily for my job, and
it has quickly become very second nature. Also, compiling posts from a Git
repository into a static HTML website is very appealing to me.

So we'll see if I can stick to this format for a while.
