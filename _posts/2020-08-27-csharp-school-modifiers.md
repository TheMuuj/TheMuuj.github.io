I realized today that more and more [C# member modifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/) can be used to describe schools these days. (Yes, this also applies to other languages that uses similar syntax, but bear with me.) It started off with the obvious `public` school and `private` school.

I suppose if you can have "old school" you can have `new` school.

School doesn't always have to be a formal institution. I learn a lot on my own from articles and videos, so you could say I attend an `abstract` school.

These days we don't want to have `unsafe` school, so often the option is `virtual` school, which can take the form of `async` school. Since this is done at home, you *might* call it `internal` school. No matter what, we want to ensure that once it's back to `extern` school that it's a well `protected` school.

That really leaves only a handful of C# member modifiers that I'd have to stretch to include here, like `static`, `sealed`, `override`, `readonly`, `partial`, and `volatile`. Well, maybe `volatile`, but that's 2020 in a nutshell.

(Also, `internal` vs `extern` bugs me as being inconsistent, even if they're orthogonal concepts in C# and `extern` was inherited from C/C++.)
