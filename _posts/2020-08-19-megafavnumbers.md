A bunch of YouTube channels are making videos about their favorite numbers over one million (`1,000,000`) and tagging them with [#MegaFavNumbers](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MegaFavNumbers).

I don't really make videos, so I'll just have to write about mine.

Since I was a kid, I've always had a favorite "meganumber." This is in addition to my usual favorite number, which I guess is in the "kilonumber" range. I also have a favorite small number for the times when people just can't deal with my usual favorites.

They're all quite related, and pretty clich√© for a programmer.

- Favorite *Mega* Number: `16,777,216`
- Favorite *Overall* Number: `65,536`
- Favorite *Small* Number: `16`

I first encountered `16,777,216` once *True Color* graphics became all the rage. I memorized the number and it sticks with me to this day. I *wish* I could memorize 2<sup>32</sup>, as that number comes up much more often in my daily work. I think if I tried at this point, I might forget my checking account number. I just know it's about four billion so I can remember how many decimal digits it has.

Honorable mention goes <code>&lfloor;&pi;&rfloor;</code>. This is really just `3`, but I like to call it "floor pi" in honor of Homer Simpson.
