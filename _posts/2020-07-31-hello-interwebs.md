# Hello, Interwebs

My first blog, which I had dubbed a "Web Journal" as the word "blog" wasn't
a thing yet, was run on a custom Classic ASP application backed by a Microsoft
Access database. I used it to learn web programming, including CSS and RSS, as
well as basic database design. Over the years, being being written in VBScript
with old legacy technologies, it became difficult to maintain and keep secure
from spammers, who were also beginning to take over the web.

Also, my friends and family members who shared the platform became busy with
their lives and stopped contributing as much.

Later, I would try blogging at various times using WordPress. I learned how to
install WordPress, customize Themes, use a Linux server, and manage a MySql
database on the web. But no matter what I did, I was never happy with WordPress
as a platform, either for blogs or for simple websites.

Also, the popularity of WordPress meant keeping the installations up to date.

Now I'm going to give Jekyll a try. I use Markdown almost daily for my job, and
it has quickly become very second nature. Also, compiling posts from a Git
repository into a static HTML website is very appealing to me.

So we'll see if I can stick to this format for a while.
