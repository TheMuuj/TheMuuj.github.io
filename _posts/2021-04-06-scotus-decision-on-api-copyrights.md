title: SCOTUS Decision on API Copyrights
tags: news legal API

In [a decision that has been in the making for over a decade](https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/04/google-wins-copyright-clash-with-oracle-over-computer-code/), the Supreme Court has affirmed that copying APIs falls under fair use.

This is, of course, a big deal for software developers. There was also concern that SCOTUS would only rule on this case but leaving the question open for future cases, meaning it could take another decade before the law was clear on the matter. Fortunately, the decision was decided as a *matter of law*.

I have been following this case since it started as it has bounced through various courts all the way to the Supreme Court. I've given presentations to colleagues about the potential ramifications of this case. I won't reiterate them here, as I feel it has been discussed *ad nauseam* at this point. I'm just relieved that it's *finally* over.

### Some Final Thoughts&hellip;

Of course, I'm oversimplifying the case and the decision. But to be fair, so is almost every article and post about the subject, and even the opinion of the Court written by Justice Breyer.

> The case involved Googleâ€™s use of certain code in its Android operating system. Google wanted Android to understand commands commonly used in the Java SE platform (which is now owned by Oracle), so it used within Android about 11,000 lines of code from Java SE. Oracle claimed that the re-use of that code without permission constituted copyright infringement.

For one, it bothers me to see this referred to as "code." It's like saying the title of a book is the story.

Early on there *was* a minor quibble because some implementation was included in the copied source, but this was an oversight on Google's part and would have been easily removable. It ended up boiling down to a `rangeCheck` function, and the judge on the original court case, the Honorable Judge William H. Alsup, was [tech-savvy enough to realize the function could have been implemented by a high school student](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber). Therefore it was far from being substantive enough to qualify for copyright, and Google gained no unfair advantage in getting its product to the market.

> "Google reimplemented a user interface, taking only what was needed to allow users to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program", Breyer wrote.

This one also gets me, a bit, and I'm always worried that the people making important legal decisions about technical issues are simply regurgitating talking points instead of fully comprehending what's at stake.

Yes, it's a "user interface" for certain definitions of "users." In this case, the *users* are programmers, in the middle, not end-users on a computer, a phone, or another device. That's why we call them APIs (application programming interfaces), because they are how applications interface with each others. A UI, on the other hand, is how applications interface with users. Sure it's semantics, but being "technically correct" is important in legal matters, no?
