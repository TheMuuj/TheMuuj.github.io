I've got quite a backlog of books to read, and a smaller, but still significant backlog of book recommendations.

I'm going to get started with some of my favorite non-fiction books about **math** and **science**, in no particular order and without any elaborate discussion or ratings.

I consider these all to be fantastic reads. Many of them have been around a long time and are on lots of recommendation lists, for sure.
